( Data from a Kaggle competition - https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales )

The objective of the project is to discover business insights based on public market data and use the findings in order to choose and train a prediction model. In this case, the sector evaluated is drug store, in which the company seeks to predict the turnover in the next 6 weeks.
